            <p>Hello! My name is Caitlin Clifford and I am currently enrolled in a full-stack web development program.</p>

            <p>My favorite part of coding so far is definitely styling with CSS! 
                I am proud of the projects I've styled thus far, 
                and I look forward to getting even better at it.</p>
